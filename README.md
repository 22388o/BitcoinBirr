**Bitcoin for Ethiopia**

Birr means Money in Amharic. 

It actually means Silver but over the years the two have come to mean the same thing. 

Over time the Ethiopian Birr has lost an incredible amount of value as compared to foreign currencies. BitcoinBirr strongly believes that the Ethiopian people will gain great strength and value from understanding Bitcoin and making it work for them. Learning comes first. Local languages are respected. Test transactions of 200 Satoshi (or "Sats" - unit of measurement) using lightning wallets are available via our [Telegram Group](https://t.me/bitcoinbirr).

> BitcoinBirr is an open source initative to educate and share bitcoin material with Africans. 2021 priorities include translating copies of various books and relevant materials in local Ethiopian and Eritrean languages, beginning with [The Little Bitcoin Book](https://littlebitcoinbook.com/).

> Thank you to all the generous supporters of this initative.

**What is Open Source?**

To promote and protect open source software and communities...

For over 20 years the Open Source Initiative (OSI) has worked to raise awareness and adoption of open source software, and build bridges between open source communities of practice. 

As a global non-profit, the OSI champions software freedom in society through education, collaboration, and infrastructure, stewarding the Open Source Definition (OSD), and preventing abuse of the ideals and ethos inherent to the open source movement.

Open source software is made by many people and distributed under an OSD-compliant license which grants all the rights to use, study, change, and share the software in modified and unmodified form. Software freedom is essential to enabling community development of open source software. [Learn more about the Open Source Initiative](opensource.org)
